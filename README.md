## About Me
I am a hobbyist programmer who has been enjoying tinkering around with the Sega Genesis and Sega CD for over a decade. I have experience programming in
C, C++, C#, Python, and Motorola 68000 Assembly, alongside experience working with OpenGL/WebGL. I've also been picking up web development, including
programming in TypeScript.

I help run a [Twitter/X account](https://twitter.com/SCDDeconstruct) that documents the inner workings of the classic Sega Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog titles.
This includes showing snippets of code, datamining efforts, restored unused content, and visualizations, all accomplished through reverse engineering efforts.

My current pet projects involves researching the fine details of how the Sega Genesis hardware works and building my own emulator based off that, alongside
aiding others in understanding these details and contributing to other various Sega Genesis related projects.
